Note:
-----
This is a fork of the original mph v1.2 obtained here:
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/devel/lang/c/!INDEX.short.html

I'm not the original maintainer and I don't intend to be. This
repository just concentrates a few small changes on the code
that I thought it would be useful to have. Also, MPH is a very
good project, so this repository also serves as a backup. We
shouldn't let the project disappear.

Original readme:
----------------
This is version 1.2 of mph, an order preserving minimal perfect hash
function generator for string keys. It uses the algorithm presented
in the paper:

        A Family of Perfect Hashing Methods
        B. S. Majewski, N. C. Wormald, G. Havas and Z. J. Czech
        Computer Journal (to appear).

The algorithm is probabilistic and runs fast in practice.

See LICENSE (and arena.c) for terms and conditions under which you
may use this software.

See mph.doc for documentation.

See subdirectory "example" for some sample outputs.
